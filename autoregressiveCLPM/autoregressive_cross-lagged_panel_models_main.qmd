***

The difference between this example and Example 5.1 is that the factor indicators are binary or ordered categorical (ordinal) variables instead of continuous variables.  The CATEGORICAL option is used to specify which dependent variables are treated as binary or ordered categorical (ordinal) variables in the model and its estimation.  In the example above, all six factor indicators are binary or ordered categorical variables.  The program determines the number of categories for each factor indicator.  The default estimator for this type of analysis is a robust weighted least squares estimator (Muthén, 1984; Muthén, du Toit, & Spisic, 1997).  With this estimator, probit regressions for the factor indicators regressed on the factors are estimated.  The ESTIMATOR option of the ANALYSIS command can be used to select a different estimator.  An explanation of the other commands can be found in Example 5.1. 

With maximum likelihood estimation, logistic regressions for the factor indicators regressed on the factors are estimated using a numerical integration algorithm.  This is shown in Example 5.5.  Note that numerical integration becomes increasingly more computationally demanding as the number of factors and the sample size increase.


## **APPENDIX CHAPTER 5 EXAMPLES: AUTOREGRESSIVE AND CROSSLAGED MODELS**

Using the xxxxx package, we evaluated the performance of the ARCL applied to longitudinal ABCD Study dataset to provide a practical example (all code available at [githublink]). For this example, we will consider the temporal association between youth report scores on the xxx (a measure of xxxxxxx) and yyy (a measure of xxxxxxx). First, we constructed a basic CLPM to simultaneously estimate the lagged association between xxxxxx (xt1) and subsequent yyyyy (yt2), as well as the lagged association between yyyyy (yt1) and subsequent xxxxx (xt2) (see single-headed arrow in Figure x, section xx). Results from this model reveal xxxxxxx (see Table x). However, the basic CLPM does not tell us anything about xxxx and assumes xxxxx.

### Autoregressive and cross-lagged panel analysis (ARCL)

Rank-order stability can be used to model interindividual stability over time as an autoregressive process,. That is, the rank-order stability can be used to model continuity of a behavior. Assuming equal intervals, the correlations between T0 and T1, and between T1 and T2 could be used to estimate the correlation between T2 and T3.

Multilevel modeling approaches have often stressed methods to tease apart different sources of variance [e.g., distinguishing level-1, or within-person, variables from level-2, or between-person, variables in the context of prospective data; see @raudenbush2002]. However, models common in SEM, such as the CLPM, have been criticized extensively on the grounds this modeling approach cannot delineate between- and within-person sources of variation and covariations [see @littlefield2021, for a review]. Briefly, the CLPM assumes no stable between-person differences (beyond the implied relations among the auto-regressive paths) among the constructs that are assessed repeated ly. As noted by @hamaker2015, "...if stability of the constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the inclusion of autoregressive parameters will fail to adequately control for this. As a result, the estimates of the cross-lagged regression coefficients will be biased, which may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the underlying causal pattern." (p. 10 2). As demonstrated by @littlefield2021, the CLPM assumes relations identical to a series of two-predictor regression models in terms of estimating variances and covariances among measurements across ti me. As described above, regression models based on two waves of assessment are limited on several fronts, including being able to tease apart between- and within-person sources of variance. @hoffman2015 notes the cross-lagged estimate "smushes" the between- and within-person effects together as a single estima te. @berry2017a notes this results in CLPM estimates "...that are difficult (or impossible) to interpret meaningfully." (p. 118 7). Given these observations, and that prospective data are often used to inform theories involving clear within-person processes [e.g., see @curran2011], models that more optimally delineate between- and within-person sources of variance are need ed.

## What it is and when to use it

The cross lagged panel model (CLPM) is a flexible analytic approach that is commonly applied when researchers are interested in understanding how variables influence each other over time. This framework requires at least two variables assessed across two measurement occassions. Consider the most basic -- and eponymously named-- CLPM, which models the lagged associations between two variables (x, y). Let 'x1' and 'y1' denote variables x and y at time 1 and allow 'x2' and 'y2' denote variables x and y at time 2. This model compares the relative effects of x and y on each other ('x1-\>y2', 'y1-\>x2') (see Figure x) and can be easily extended to evaluate other hypothesized relationships. For example, evaluating contemporaneous associations between variables assessed during the same measurement occassion (e.g., 'x1 \<-\> y1'; 'x2 \<-\> y2'; see Figure x) is straightforward. Another common CLPM extension is the inclusion of autoregressive effects (e.g., 'x1-\>x2', 'y1-\>y2'; see Figure x). Also referred to as an autoregressive cross-lagged [ARCL] model, this extension provides an estimate of a variable's temporal (i.e., rank order) stability over time. The larger the value of the autoregressive coefficient (closer to 1) the more stable (greater % of variance explained in) the variable across measurement occasions. When contemporaneous (e.g., x1 \<-\> y1) and autoregressive effects (e.g., x1 -\> x2) are included, the standardized cross-lagged parameters of an ARCL model are often inferred as representing the bidirectional 'between-person' effects of 'x1-\>y2' (when controlling for y1) and 'y1-\>x2' (when controlling for x1).

One advantage of longitudinal analyses with multiple waves of data collection is that such processes can be modeled over time. Understanding transactional effects effects can be useful in devising strategies to intervene in various types of escalating cycles of violence such as child maltreatment [@cicchetti2006a) or the effects of intimate partner violence on child behavior problems [@chung2021]. Such processes could be modeled statistically in a number of ways by relying on estimating cross-lagged relations but require at least three times of measurement in order to distinguish beween-subject and within-sources of measurement [@hamaker2015; see discussion below).
