This approach computes a raw difference score as an index change ($\\Delta$) in relation to some variable ($x$) by subtracting the variable's value obtained at a prior measurement occasion (t1) from the value of the same variable obtained at a subsequent  occasion (t2). This difference value ($\\Delta$ = $x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$) can then be used as the outcome in a GLM to test for differences in the amount of change over time and between groups of interest.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n# Model Assumptions\ntest test\n\n<!-- NOTES\napproach- each method is presented according to the following triplet: \n(1) when to apply it and what is it doing\n(2) how to compute it in R \n(3) how to present, visualize, and interpret the results\n-->\n\n# Notes_TBD\nSince the data being compared at exactly two points in time is paired (non-independent), the paired t-test analysis is appropriate.

Note: the “rule of thumb” is that neither group should be smaller than 6, and ideally has more.\nIndependent Observations: Individuals within each sample and between the two groups are independent of each other—random selection indicates that the chances of any one “unit” being sampled are independent of the chances for any other being sampled.\nHomogeneity of Variance: Variance is the same for the two groups, as indicated by equal standard deviations in the two samples.\n\n:::\n\n<div class=\"bd-callout bd-callout-info\">\n<h3 id=\"dealing-with-specificity\", style=\"color:light\"> test </h3>\n\n> !Important Note.\n>These models (t-test, ANOVA, and regression) are equivalent and all are subsumed by the GLM framework. More specifically, ANOVA is a special case of regression analysis where all the predictor variables are categorical. For the two-group case, the ANOVA model can be written as the following regression model $x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$=$β_0$ + $β_1$ *C* + $\\epsilon$ ($x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$) where $x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$ is the difference between Time 2 ($_{t2}$) and Time 1 ($_{t1}$) scores, $β_0$  is the intercept or average predicted value of the difference across time for individuals in group = 0, ''$β_1$' is the regression coefficient for *C* indicating the difference in difference scores between between group = 0 and group = 1, and $\\epsilon$($x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$) is the residual (i.e., error) score (normally distributed with zero mean) that captures all other factors not accounted for by the grouping predictor. Typically, the effect of interest is \"$β_1$\", which represents the difference between the average difference scores of the two groups. \n___\n\n>**Key Considerations & Limitations**\n>+ Imbalanced baseline scores\n>\t+ If baseline scores are imbalanced across groups, effect estimates of the mean difference score may become biased (via regression to the mean).

First, compute the difference ($\\Delta$) between the score ($x$) obtained at baseline ($x_{t1}$) and follow-up ($x_{t2}$) for each individual ($(\\Delta = x_{t2} − x_{t1})$). This difference value ($\\Delta$ = $x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$) can then be used as the outcome in a GLM to test for differences in the amount of change over time and between groups of interest. \n\nand divide by the sample size (n) to obtain the *sample average of differences*.\n(e.g., pre/post test scores) \n\n#### **Single-Group Repeated Measures Design:** {#sec-equation}\nThe most basic repeated measures design the involves a single-group repeated measures design.\nIn this design, we have n repeated measures of the response on each of N subjects.\n\n##### (Paired Samples T-test)\nThe paired samples (matched-pairs) t-test (t-testp) can be used to determine whether the difference between some pair of values (e.g., pre/post test scores) produced by the same individual across two measurement occasions, differs significantly from 0. The t-testp is a special case of the one-sample t-test, with the exception that this model needs to be modified to account for the statistical dependence among repeated observations obtained on the same subject, other than the issue of non-independence the underlying assumptions for the t-testp is exactly the same as for the independent samples t-test. \n\nTo compute the t-testp ($(\\Delta = x_{t2} − x_{t1})$) the *sample average of differences* value obtained from the formula provided in step 1 ($(\\Delta = x_{t2} − x_{t1})$) will be used as the numerator in your calculation of the t-value. The denominator in this computation is a variance estimate (i.e., the sample standard error), which accounts for the covariance between initial levels and change. A significant t-statistic indicates that change $(\\Delta)$ from T1 to T2 is significantly greater than 0.\n\n> Hypothetical Scenario:\nTable 1. Raw and difference scores before and after training.\n\nTable 1 shows scores on a quiz that five employees received before they took a training course and after they took the course. The difference between these scores (i.e. the score after minus the score before) represents improvement in the employees’ ability. This third column is what we look at when assessing whether or not our training was effective. We want to see positive scores, which indicate that the employees’ performance went up. \n\n##### (rANOVA)\nThe repeated-measures (within-subjects) ANOVA is an extension of the paired-samples t-test that is used to determine whether mean scores on some outcome measured at three or more occasions differs significantly across measurement occasions. \n\n#### **Basic T-testp/ANOVA:**\ncan be extended for multiple groups and 3+ timepoints\n1) **T-test**/**ANOVA**:\n+ A t-test can be performed using a grouping variable to examine whether the disparity in the mean difference value differs significantly between two groups. An ANOVA can be used if the grouping variable includes more than 2 groups.\n\nThe basic one-way repeated measure ANOVA can be extended (e.g., two-way, three-way) to evaluate whether or not a significant interaction effect exists between two or more factors (groups/levels) of some within-subjects variable.\n\n\t+ Example based on hypothetical \n\t\t+ First we compute the difference ($\\Delta$) between the score on the measure of screen time ($x$) assessed at baseline ($x_{t1}$) and follow-up ($x_{t2}$). \n\t\t+ The result of this formula ($\\Delta$=$x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$) can then be used as an outcome to test the effect of group on  the difference score ($\\Delta_{boys}$,  $\\Delta_{girls}$ ). \n\t\t+ Figure x.\n\n>GLM Equation:\n$RS{_n}{_2} - RS{_n}{_1} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 Cn + e_{n(RS2-RS1)}$\n\nwhere RSn2 􏰫 RSn1 is the difference between Time 2 and Time 1 scores, g0 is the intercept or average predicted value of the difference across time in relationship satis- faction for those who did not cohabit prior to marriage (Cn 1⁄4 0), g1 is the regression coefficient for Cn indicating the difference in change between Time 1 and Time 2 between those who cohabited and those who did not, and en(RS2􏰫RS1) is the residual score that captures all other factors not accounted for by the cohabited predictor. Importantly, if the key predictor, Cn, was continuous (e.g., number of months couples lived together before marriage), the model in Equation 2 would no longer be called repeated measures ANOVA, but Sofia could compute the difference score variable herself and run a simple linear regression with Cn as the sole predictor to assess whether increases in time cohabiting prior to marriage predict change in relationship satisfaction.\n\n> Hypothetical Scenario:\n> \tA study investigates sex differences on a measure of screen time by examining change in screen time scores obtained across two measurement occasions for boys and girls. The study aims to determine whether sex has an effect on changes in screen time across assessments.\n\n#### **Basic Regression:**\n2) **Regression**:\n+  A simple regression analysis can be performed using a grouping variable as a predictor of change ($\\Delta$) in an outcome across groups. A significant effect for the grouping variable indicates that average $\\Delta$ is significantly different across groups.\n\t+ Example based on hypothetical\n\t\t+ First we compute the difference ($\\Delta$) between the score on the measure of screen time ($x$) assessed at baseline ($x_{t1}$) and follow-up ($x_{t2}$). \n\t\t+ The result of this formula ($\\Delta$=$x_{t2}$ - $x_{t1}$) can be included as the outcome variable in a regression model that analyzes the role of the grouping variable (0 = boy; 1 = girl) on changes in screen time across measurement occassions.\n\t+ Figure x.\n:::\n\n## Explanation of Model Code & Plots\n### Model code\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"difference_scores_main.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.258","comments":{"hypothesis":true},"bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo","code-copy":true},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","include-in-header":{"text":"\\usepackage{makeidx}\n\\makeindex\n"},"include-after-body":{"text":"\\printindex\n"},"output-file":"difference_scores_main.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"comments":{"hypothesis":true},"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
